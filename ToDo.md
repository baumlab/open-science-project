## To Do  
#### May 4, 2017    
* email Rhyne asking for range size data or ask how soon we will have this data, also ask about the CITES membership/species list if he already has this  *JPWR*  
* literature search for metrics we can use, how do people measure effectiveness of countries governance and protection measures *JMI*, *EW*
* species data: data exploration, are big species within our data? think about ways to aggregate the data  *JPWR*, *EW*

* thinking about standardising fish number + diversity by coastline/reef area/species richness. GIS/UNEP data sources - need GIS skillz to extract national estimates.
* then, examine standardised aquarium trade as function of governance indicators 
* still waiting on range size data...
