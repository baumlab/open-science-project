* email Rhyne asking for range size data or ask how soon we will have this data, also ask about the CITES membership/species list if he already has this  *JPWR*  
* literature search for metrics we can use, how do people measure effectiveness of countries governance and protection measures *JMI*, *EW*
* species data: data exploration, are big species within our data? think about ways to aggregate the data  *JPWR*, *EW*
