abstract = {Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons were determined in three species of commercial shellfish, namely razor shells (Ensis arcuatus and Ensis siliqua), goose barnacle (Pollicipes cornucopia) and sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus), living in different habitats and exhibiting different feeding behaviors. The samples were collected monthly, from January 2003 to October 2004, in three stations of the Galicia coast (NW Spain), following the Prestige oil spill, with the aim of assessing their response to the spill and, therefore, their suitability for monitoring purposes. The aliphatic fractions were mostly dominated by biogenic hydrocarbons, reflecting the diet composition of the organisms and their low metabolic capacity. The presence of oil was assessed by the determination of chemical markers. The analysis of the aromatic fractions revealed the occurrence of 3-6 ring parent and alkylated PAHs, consistent with a mixed petrogenic-pyrolytic origin, with the common feature of the predominance of chrysene in all samples collected after the spill. However, the distributions exhibited both temporal and interspecies variations. The PAH concentrations (??13) increased significantly after the spill and decreased 6-7 months later close to background levels for the region. One year after the accident, the median values were: 58 ??g/kg for razor shells, 26 ??g/kg for barnacles, and 25 ??g/kg for sea urchins. The temporal evolution of the PAH concentrations along the survey period was used to estimate loss rates for bioavailable PAHs in barnacles and sea urchins after the spill. Half-life values were in the order of 30 and 60 d, respectively. The results of the study demonstrate that barnacles can be suitable species for oil spill monitoring. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Genetic differentiation among the populations surveyed was observed, with the meanFst for all loci 0.031 (SDÂ¼0.007). The Alison Sound population in the British Columbia central coast displayed less genetic variation and was distinct from all other populations in British Columbia, with pairwiseFst values {\textgreater}0.12, over 20 times the differentiation in other comparisons. The results were consistent with a high level of retention of larval crabs within Alison Sound, owing to reduced water exchange between the sound and adjacent waters. There was no evidence for an isolation by distance model of population structure of Dungeness crab in British Columbia, but there was some indication of differentiation between a west coast Vancouver Island population and a population adjacent to the southern Strait of Georgia.},

abstract = {Environmental variation reflected by the North Atlantic Oscillation affects breeding and survival in terrestrial vertebrates, and climate change is predicted to have an impact on population dynamics by influencing food quality or availability. The North Atlantic Oscillation also affects the abundance of marine fish and zooplankton, but it is unclear whether this filters up trophic levels to long-lived marine top predators. Here we show by analysis of data from a 50-year study of the fulmar that two different indices of ocean climate variation may have lagged effects on population dynamics in this procellariiform seabird. Annual variability in breeding performance is influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation, whereas cohort differences in recruitment are related to temperature changes in the summer growing season in the year of birth. Because fulmars exhibit delayed reproduction, there is a 5-year lag in the population's response to these effects of environmental change. These data show how interactions between different climatic factors result in complex dynamics, and that the effects of climate change may take many years to become apparent in long-lived marine top predators.},

abstract = {A population dynamics model was used to simulate variations in the standing stock of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, to assess the marketable production in Thau Lagoon (France) and to evaluate the sensitivity of this production to environmental conditions. The model is based on a continuous equation of the oyster abundance as a function of individual growth rate, inter-individual growth variability and mortality rate. The growth model depends on water temperature, particulate organic matter concentration and total individual mass. Inter-individual growth variability was introduced into the general population dynamics equation by a diffusion coefficient K that was set to 0.05. The population dynamics model took into account the two culture methods (i.e. "coll??es" and "pignes" oysters) and rearing strategies of oyster farmers by using timetables of seeding and harvesting obtained through interviews of oyster farmers. Distributions of standing stocks were obtained through assessments conducted in the lagoon in March 2000, October 2000 and March 2001 and were used to calibrate the model. The model estimated the total marketable production at ca. 17,900 t between March 2000 and March 2001. The major part of the production (ca. 70{\%}) was in spring. Seventy percent of the annual production came from "coll?? es" oysters. Sensitivity analyses showed that the key parameters are those related to harvesting. The model was used to evaluate the effects of different environmental conditions (e.g. a decrease in the oyster growth rate, a harvesting closure due a toxic algae bloom, a massive summer mortality due to an anoxic crisis) on short- and long-term variations in the standing stock and the production for both culture methods. A decrease in the growth rate of ca. 20{\%} resulted in losses of 18{\%} in the first year of production for both culture methods. Long-term simulations showed that the production of "pignes" oysters was more affected than that of the "coll??es" oysters (reductions of 26{\%} and 4{\%}, respectively). Simulated scenarios included a 2-month long harvesting closure (i.e. November and December) or a massive summer mortality (i.e. 45{\%} and 20{\%} for "coll??es" and "pignes" oysters, respectively). No long-term effect was predicted for either event, although losses of ca. 10{\%} were estimated in the first year of production for both culture techniques. The model can be a useful tool for predicting marketable production of oysters as a function of rearing strategy and environmental conditions. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig was destroyed by an explosion and fire, and the oil well began releasing oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The oil spill caused significant economic harm to the Gulf fishing industry because of fishery closures and consumer concerns related to the safety of Gulf seafood. Intermediate and long-term concerns are related to impacts on marine populations and degradation of fisheries habitat necessary for spawning, development of early life stages, and growth. The closing and opening of fishing grounds has involved a tradeoff between ensuring public safety and providing fishing opportunities to recreational and commercial fishermen. In addition to public health concerns, uncertainties related to Gulf seafood safety could further compromise the reputation of Gulf seafood. Most areas have been reopened and landings of commercial and recreational species are recovering. For Gulf waters re-opened through November 15, 2010, sensory analyses of seafood samples have found no detectable oil or dispersant odors or flavors, and results of chemical analyses have been well below levels of concern. However, some scientists and the public remain skeptical of claims that Gulf seafood is safe. This may inhibit the recovery of Gulf recreational and commercial fisheries.},

At least 22{\%} is intentionally released as a function of normal tanker âoperational discharges,â 12{\%} enters from accidental tanker spills and another 36{\%} from runoff and municipal and industrial wastes.$\backslash$nInvertebrate populations and communities form the foundation for marine ecosystems and are continually subjected to stresses from both chronic and acute oil toxicity. The diversity of invertebrate taxa represented in the marine environment exhibit a wide range of responses to oil. Mortality is an obvious impact resulting from catastrophic spills or even chronic toxicity. Sublethal impacts on individuals are manifested by physiological, carcinogenic and cytogenetic effects. Impacts typically felt at the population level involve changes in abundance, age structure, population genetic structure, reproduction and reduced recruitment potential. Community level impacts are typified by modified interactions between competitors, predator/prey and symbionts. Most importantly, changes in community structure represented by altered trophic interactions tend to produce the most dramatic alterations to natural invertebrate assemblages.$\backslash$nInvertebrate communities respond to severe chronic oil pollution and/or acute catastrophic oil pollution in much the same way. Initial massive mortality and lowered community diversity is followed by extreme fluctuations in populationsof opportunistic mobile and sessile fauna (and flora). Oscillations in population numbers slowly dampen over time and diversity slowly increases to original levels. The time over which these events occur depends on the type of oil, the extent of the initial contamination, habitat type, weather conditions, latitude, the species assemblages represented and a myriad of other complex factors.},

abstract = {The molluscan shellfish resource of Puerto Rico is composed of a variety of gastropods and bivalves, but the two prominent species are the queen conch, Strombus gigas, and the mangrove oyster, Crassostrea rhizophorae. The fishery historically can be divided into three phases. The first occur-red during the pre-Columbian period. The harvest of mollusks is one of the principal characteristics of the Taino culture, with the shells of some species also being used as tools or ornamentation. The second period covers the time from Spanish colonization through the first half of the 1900's. During this time there was little interest in molluscan fishing, although oysters were commercially harvested to some degree toward the end of the period. The most recent era is characterized by the development of large-scale fisheries for the queen conch and mangrove oyster. The former fishery peaked in 1983, yielding an estimated 930,000, but landings have since dropped by 70{\%}. The oyster fishery, once widespread, now has been reduced to a single lagoon. The catch fluctuates and is valued at less than 100,000 per year.},

abstract = {WDFW is mandated to perform biological stock assessment of the commercial geoduck resource and to make annual recommendations on the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for each geoduck management region. Systematically spaced strip transect surveys are used to estimate the density of harvestable geoducks within commercial tracts, and a sample of geoducks is taken from these transects to estimate average weight. Biomass estimates on commercial tracts are the product of mean biomass per unit area and the total area of the tract. Regional biomass estimates are the sum of all surveyed commercial tract estimates within the region. Regional TACs are the product of the regional biomass estimate and the recommended harvest rate. An age-based equilibrium yield model was used to predict the long-term consequences of various harvest rates, using geoduck life history parameters which were estimated from existing WDFW data and literature sources. The model predicts yield and spawning biomass per recruit over a range of fishing mortality rates. Five commonly-used constant harvest rate strategies were simulated with the model, including two based on yield-per-recruit analysis and three based on spawning biomass per recruit analysis. An F40{\%} strategy is recommended as a risk-averse policy for geoducks. Under an F40{\%} strategy, the recommended annual TAC is 2.7{\%} of the current commercial biomass within a region.},

abstract = {Aquaculture of filter-feeding bivalve mollusks involves the fruitful conversion of marine particulate organic matter into premium protein of high nutritive value. Culture performance of bivalves is largely dependent on hydrological conditions and directly affected by e.g. temperature and chlorophyll levels. Accordingly, these parameters may be related with seasonality but also with oceanographic features combined with climate events. Yields of Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas) reared at commercial procedures in suspended structures (long-lines) in a sheltered bay in Southern Brazil (Santa Catarina State, 27S 43'; 48. W 30') were evaluated in relation to local environmental conditions: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and associate effects of cold fronts events and El Ni??o and La Ni??a periods. Outputs from four consecutive commercial crop years were analyzed (2005/06, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09) in terms of oyster survival and development time during the following grow-out phases of the culture cycle: seed to juvenile, juvenile to adult, adult to marketable. Since culture management and genetics were standardized significant differences verified among crop performance could be mostly related to environmental effects. Time series of temperature and chlorophyll a (remote sensing data) from crop periods displayed significant seasonal and interannual variation. As expected, performance during initial grow-out stages (seed to juvenile) was critical for final crop yield. Temperature was the main factor affecting survival in these initial stages with a trend of negative correlation, though not statistically significant. On the other hand, oyster development rate was significantly and positively affected by chlorophyll a concentration. Chlorophyll a values could be increased by upwelled cold nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW, related to predominant Northern winds) though further dependent on occurrence of Southern winds (cold fronts) to assist seawater penetration into the sheltered farming area. Lower salinity nutrient-rich northward drifted waters from La Plata River discharge may also result in chlorophyll a rise in the farming area. The El Ni??o period (July 2006 to February 2007) coincided with lower chlorophyll a levels in the farming site that may be related to both decreased number of cold fronts as well as predominance of Northern winds that retain northward spreading of La Plata River discharge waters. In contrast, the La Ni??a period (August 2007 to June 2008) corresponded to higher chlorophyll a values in the farming area by both upwelling of SACW and penetration of La Plata River discharge water assisted by increased occurrence of Southern winds and cold fronts. The recognition of the potentially changing climate and effects upon the environment will be an important step in planning future development of bivalve aquaculture. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The "Tsesis" oil spill in October 1977 resulted in the release of over 1 000 tons of medium grade fuel oil in an archipelago in the brackish Baltic Sea. Considerable oil quantities reached the benthos by sedimentation. Within 16 d benthic amphipods of the genus Pontoporeia, as well as the polychaete Harmothoe sarsi Kinberg, showed re-duction to less than 5{\%} of pre-spill biomasses at the most impacted station. The clam Macoma balthica (L.) was more resistant, and showed little or no mortality, but was heavily contaminated by oil (about 2 000/{\~{}}g g-1 dry wt total hydrocarbons). The meiofauna was strongly affected, with ostracods, harpacticoids, Turbellaria and kinorhynchs showing clear reductions in abundance, while nematodes, as a group, were more resistant. In the winter following the spill gravid Pontoporeia affinis Lindstr6m females showed a statistically significant increase in the frequency of abnormal or undifferentiated eggs. Food-chain transfer of oil to flounder [Platichthys flesus (L.)] was indicated. Not until the second summer after the spill were the first signs of recovery noted at the most heavily impacted station: Amphipods, H. sarsi and harpacticoids increased and the oil concentrations in M. balthica decreased (to about 1 000{\#}g g-i). In the area where amphipods had been virtually eliminated, there was an unusually heavy recruitment of M. balthica, reaching 4 000 juveniles, of 1.5-2 mm length, per square metre, probably from settling in summer 1978. Three years after the spill Pontoporeia spp. biomass was still depressed in the most affected area, while H. sarsi showed normal biomass, and M. balthica abundance was inflated. Oil concentrations in M. balthica (about 250/{\~{}}gg -1) and flounder were only slightly ele-vated and the oil could no longer be confidently ascribed to "Tsesis" origin, even using GC/MS-analysis. Recovery was thus underway, but the long lifespan of M. balthica * To whom requests for reprints and correspondence should be addressed implies that the disturbed community composition may persist for many years at this station. Full recovery .is likely to require more than 5 yr and may take a decade or more. An effort to evaluate the accumulated monetary loss to fishery from the accident indicates that direct costs of shoreline cleanup and vessel damage were considerably greater.},

abstract = {In September 1969, the Florida barge spilled 700,000 L of No. 2 fuel oil into the salt marsh sediments of Wild Harbor (Buzzards Bay, MA). Today the aboveground environment appears unaffected, but a substantial amount of moderately degraded petroleum still remains 8-20 cm below the surface. The salt marsh fiddler crabs, Uca pugnax, burrow into the sediments at depths of 5-25 cm, and are chronically exposed to the spilled oil. Behavioral studies conducted with U. pugnax from Wild Harbor and a control site, Great Sippewissett marsh, found that crabs exposed to the oil avoided burrowing into oiled layers, suffered delayed escape responses, lowered feeding rates, and achieved lower densities. The oil residues are therefore biologically active and affect U. pugnax populations. Our results add new knowledge about long-term consequences of spilled oil, a dimension that should be included when assessing oil-impacted areas and developing management plans designed to restore, rehabilitate, or replace impacted areas. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Time series regression studies have been widely used in environmental epidemiology, notably in investigating the short-term associations between exposures such as air pollution, weather variables or pollen, and health outcomes such as mortality, myocardial infarction or disease-specific hospital admissions. Typically, for both exposure and outcome, data are available at regular time intervals (e.g. daily pollution levels and daily mortality counts) and the aim is to explore short-term associations between them. In this article, we describe the general features of time series data, and we outline the analysis process, beginning with descriptive analysis, then focusing on issues in time series regression that differ from other regression methods: modelling short-term fluctuations in the presence of seasonal and long-term patterns, dealing with time varying confounding factors and modelling delayed ('lagged') associations between exposure and outcome. We finish with advice on model checking and sensitivity analysis, and some common extensions to the basic model.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide by 36{\%} during the past 200 years. One third of all anthropogenic CO(2) has been absorbed by the oceans, reducing pH by about 0.1 of a unit and significantly altering their carbonate chemistry. There is widespread concern that these changes are altering marine habitats severely, but little or no attention has been given to the biota of estuarine and coastal settings, ecosystems that are less pH buffered because of naturally reduced alkalinity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To address CO(2)-induced changes to estuarine calcification, veliger larvae of two oyster species, the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and the Suminoe oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis) were grown in estuarine water under four pCO(2) regimes, 280, 380, 560 and 800 microatm, to simulate atmospheric conditions in the pre-industrial era, present, and projected future concentrations in 50 and 100 years respectively. CO(2) manipulations were made using an automated negative feedback control system that allowed continuous and precise control over the pCO(2) in experimental aquaria. Larval growth was measured using image analysis, and calcification was measured by chemical analysis of calcium in their shells. C. virginica experienced a 16{\%} decrease in shell area and a 42{\%} reduction in calcium content when pre-industrial and end of 21(st) century pCO(2) treatments were compared. C. ariakensis showed no change to either growth or calcification. Both species demonstrated net calcification and growth, even when aragonite was undersaturated, a result that runs counter to previous expectations for invertebrate larvae that produce aragonite shells. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE Our results suggest that temperate estuarine and coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to the expected changes in water chemistry due to elevated atmospheric CO(2) and that biological responses to acidification, especially calcifying biota, will be species-specific and therefore much more variable and complex than reported previously.},

abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined in tissues of wild mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from the Galicia coast (NW Spain) in order to assess the extent of the environmental impact caused by the Prestige oil spill (November 13, 2002). Three sampling campaigns were carried out in February, June and November 2003 at 24 stations along the Galicia coast, from La Guardia (Pontevedra) to Ribadeo (Lugo). The spatial distribution of PAHs found in the first sampling period, clearly revealed the central area (Costa da Morte) as the most affected by the oil spill. In these stations, concentrations up to 7780????g/kg dw of the sum of 13 parent PAHs were found 2-3??months after the spill. Molecular parameters within the aliphatic and aromatic fractions confirmed the presence of the Prestige oil in these samples. The levels markedly decreased at most of the stations in the second sampling and recovered to levels found before the spill in November 2003, 1??year after the accident (29-279????g/kg dw, av. 133 ?? 83????g/kg dw). However, a certain increase was observed in some sites which could be related to the remobilization of oil residues from still unclean intertidal spots or sediments due to the winter marine weather conditions. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Accidents and spillages are an inevitable consequence of the worldwide transport of crude oil and refined petroleum products by sea. The number of major spills occurring each year has de- creased since the 1970s, but spillages and operational discharges from tankers nonetheless constitute a significant input of oil to the marine environment. The rapid uptake of oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by exposed fish and shellfish, resulting from large oil spillages in coastal waters, poses a po- tential threat to human consumers of fish and shellfish and also affects the marketability of catches. In this article, the processes influencing uptake and retention of PAHs in fish and shellfish are outlined by drawing on the experience gained from previous incidents. This includes particular reference to three recent ma- jor oil spills from tankers in the United Kingdom and the United States, those involving the Exxon Valdez , Braer , and Sea Em- press , and to the resulting contamination of local stocks . A more uniform approach to oil spill monitoring would aid comparisons between spills and would help interpret the kinetics and dynam- ics of released hydrocarbons in future cases. Currently, no statu- tory limits or guideline values have been established for PAHs in edible tissues of fish or shellfish, whether derived from oil or combustion sources.},

Examining the evolution of landings in the Death Coast before and after the accident, the analysis reveals two opposing trends, with landings of some species increasing and those of other species diminishing. However, it is necessary to stress that the results obtained from the use of landings as a main indicator are not enough to confirm the influence of the oil spill on stocks. Moreover, these results are quite predictable, since factors such as the species relationship with substratum, their sensitivity to the polluting oil, the way they prey on one another and the fishing effort, all affect these preliminary conclusions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
