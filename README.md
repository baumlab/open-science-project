Ideas, data, R scripts, figures, and writing for Baum lab #OpenDerby



#### Skype call - 23rd Jan 2016 - JR, JMI, EW, DC, JD

1. Oil data - US only so far (NOAA). BC aren't providing data. 
2. Fish data - NOAA landings for some ports only go back 15 years. JR: Email requests provided monthly data - razorclam and crabs, by port, WA and OR; JMI: California landings, but in PDF format (can be dealt with using Tabula program)
3. Sea Around Us data sounds good. Need to hear back from data provider.
          
To do

* Need to think about responses - DC making spreadsheet with published response vars, critique and apply to our question
* Think about other environmental drivers of shellfish populations - could separate dataset according to stable/unstable population dynamics
* How variable is shellfish recruitment? Need to account for unusual years? Find papers on environmental drivers of population dynamics.
* Time-series analyses. EW: simulations to see what we need to be running?
