# Ideas


Brainstorm ideas here guys. Like I said, we won't start until January, but if you have any problems you think could be analysed with open data just chuck them in.

### 1. Large MPA effectiveness

Question: How effective are large MPAs in excluding boat traffic?

Dataset: [Automatic Identification System] (http://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:-179/centery:32/zoom:7) 

Study area: [10 largest MPAs] (http://www.protectplanetocean.org/collections/introduction/introbox/globalmpas/introduction-item.html)

Relevant links: [Global Fishing Watch] (http://globalfishingwatch.org/faq)  
[Article about big data and tracking fishing vessels] (http://e360.yale.edu/feature/how_satellites_and_big_data_can_help_to_save_the_oceans/2982/)  
[PEW's Eyes on the Seas] (http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/multimedia/video/2015/project-eyes-on-the-seas)  
  
Relevant papers: [McCauley et al. 2016 Science] (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kristina_Boerder/publication/297743086_Ending_hide_and_seek_at_sea/links/56e4839108aedb4cc8ac2605.pdf) 
[Brodeur et al. PLoS ONE; Improving Fishing Pattern Detection from Satellite AIS Using Data Mining and Machine Learning] (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0158248). I think the author K Brodeur is pretty much doing her PhD on this stuff. Tim White (Hopkins Marine lab) should have a paper soon on using AIS for the Palmyra Atoll

Here is a recent short note on what looks like a [working group on AIS] (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1609/1609.08756.pdf)
  
Relevant data:  
Are countries with higher GDPs better at enforcing MPA protection? [GDP Data]
(http://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm)  

*Pros:*

* Huge relevance given recent creation of new 'super' MPAs
* High resolution, reliable data is available
* Either way (MPAs work or MPAs don't work), result is interesting + useful

*Cons:*

* When is a fishing boat actually fishing?
* How do MPA restrictions vary between MPAs?
* Seems like something that may have been done already - lit search


### 2. Evaluating past predictions

Question: How well do we make predictions in ecology?

Dataset: We would have to compile a dataset of papers depending on the specific question.

Easton's thoughts: We could evalulate how predictions from fishery models or the effects of climate change on particular species were either correct or way off. We would look at older papers (say pre 2000) and see if there predictions actually held up. Hope that makes some sense

### 3. Living Planet Index

This website has census data for 18,000 populations around the globe. They have already done some work assessing population trends (e.g. how do aquatic organisms fare compared to terrestrial species?). I think there is ample room to dig futher into the data though. Perhaps we could connect this to other abiotic or human activity databases as well?
