# Ideas


Brainstorm ideas here guys. Like I said, we won't start until January, but if you have any problems you think could be analysed with open data just chuck them in.

### 1. Large MPA effectiveness

Question: How effective are large MPAs in excluding boat traffic?

Dataset: [Automatic Identification System] (http://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:-179/centery:32/zoom:7) 

Study area: [10 largest MPAs] (http://www.protectplanetocean.org/collections/introduction/introbox/globalmpas/introduction-item.html)

Relevant links: [Global Fishing Watch] (http://globalfishingwatch.org/faq)

*Pros:*

* Huge relevance given recent creation of new 'super' MPAs
* High resolution, reliable data is available
* Either way (MPAs work or MPAs don't work), result is interesting + useful

*Cons:*

* When is a fishing boat actually fishing?
* How do MPA restrictions vary between MPAs?
* Seems like something that may have been done already - lit search
