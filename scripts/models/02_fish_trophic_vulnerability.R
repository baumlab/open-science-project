#### Question 2

# *Are certain trophic levels or functional groups disproportionately targeted by aquarium trade, 
#  and does this pattern vary regionally? * 

# **Hypotheses**: 
#  The planktivores are primarily targeted because of their size (small, 
#  easy to collect many and popular for small aquariums). 

# **Data**: FishBase (89 of our 100 species matched). Provides FoodTL estimates
