#### Question 3
# *Geographic analysis of range distributions - 
#  where are species exported from? 
#  Are small or large range size fishes exported more or less?*

# **Hypotheses**: Positive linear relationship between export occurences and range size, 
#  as species with a larger range size will exported by more countries. 
# However if any species fall of this line they are of interest: 
# 1) smaller range size for volume = high risk; 
# 2) larger range size than volume = low risk?

# **Data**: OBIS range sizes (from this calculated EOO:
  # extent of occurence),
