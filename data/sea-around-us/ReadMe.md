Sea Around Us Data: landings + discards are not separate

At SAU, we define commercial catch as any catch in the Industrial and Artisanal sectors.

Caveats:
"We can give that data, however, you need to be fully aware of the caveats and limitations of our spatial allocation at scales that are below the scale of EEZs. 

Our data and allocation were designed for a global large-scale use, not a sub-EEZ spatial use. 

Furthermore, local factors such as oil spills or anything as such are never considered in our data. 

Finally, spatial allocation to 1/2 degree cells that are coastal, are most problematic, given the global scale of all our work. 

We generally recommend that researchers use other, local and regional research data for spatial work at sub-EEZ levels."
