## Aquarium Fish Trade Proposal 
By: Robinson J, Claar D, Dunic J, McDevitt-Irwin J, Osgood G, and White E  


#### Introduction  
Recent studies have quantified the impact of exporting wildlife on ecosystems.... and asking for examples where hotspots of high wildlife export and governance effectiveness varies across countries.


#### Goals  

1. Use IUCN data to identify aquarium trade "threat hotspots", which export Red List species or species that are also threatened by fishing   

2. Evaluate effectiveness of trade regulations by comparing aquarium exports from countries with strong vs weak regulations/governance (e.g. CITES members and n. years since joining, GDP)    


#### Data   
1. Number of individuals per fish species exported by each country to the United States  
2. Country Level: If they are a part of CITES
3. Species Being Exported: CITES appendix, IUCN status  

We are interested in the invertebrate data, but would like to focus on the fish for now.  Use the three year dataset: 2008, 2009, 2011. We could consider first determining aquarium fish trade patterns across the south pacific and then applying our analysis to a global scale.
