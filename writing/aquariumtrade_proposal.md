#### Introduction  

Understanding the impacts of wildlife export trade on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is critical for effective regulation of animal trade. Recently, studies have identified IUCN hotspots subject to high levels of export (Moran & Kanemoto, 2017, Nature), and identified variation in  governance effectiveness across countries (Dee et al. 2014, Biol. Cons.; Cardador et al. 2017, Cons. Lett.). In coral reefs, aquarium trade of fish species can add exploitation pressure to lower trophic levels and remove highly-threatened species, but traded species are often unregulated and export data is unavailable (Rhyne et al. 2012 PLoS ONE; Deet et al. 2014). Consequently, our understanding of regional variation in aquarium pressure and target species is limited.

We propose to analyse regional variation in reef fish species exported to the US, particularly considering impacts on IUCN and CITES listed species in the context of country-level fisheries sustainability. 

#### Research questions  

1. Are certain regions or countries experiencing stronger impacts from aquarium trade? Use IUCN data to identify aquarium trade "threat hotspots", defined as A) the number of Red List species exported by a country and B) the number of species that are also threatened by fishing 

2. Are threat hotspots in systems that are already considered highly threatened? Examine relationship between coral reef fishery condition and threat hotspot, using published fishery sustainability estimates (e.g. Newton et al. 2007, Current Biology).

2. How effective are trade regulations in controlling aquarium export? Examine threat hotspots by regulations/governance strength, based on CITES membership, n. years since joining CITES, and GDP.

*Possible additional question*

4 . Are certain trophic levels or functional groups disproportionately targeted by aquarium trade, and does this pattern vary regionally? Examine size, diet, and functional group structure of exported species by country. *Issue with this question is that determining the baseline community structure is very difficult, probably impossible*.

  
#### Data required from Aquariumtradedata.org 

1. Number of individuals, by species, exported by each country to the US in 2008, 2009, 2011

2. CITES membership for each country, and list of CITES protected species

3. List of species with IUCN Red List status  

You also mentioned longer term invertebrate data. We would like to focus on the fish for now, just to get ourselves familiar with the dataset and because our backgrounds are all in reef fish. Going forward, if we find interesting results with the fish trade, we would certainly be interested in extending our approach to think about other species.
