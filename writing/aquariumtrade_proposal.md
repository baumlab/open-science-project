## Aquarium Fish Trade Proposal
By: Robinson J, Claar D, Dunic J, McDevitt-Irwin J, Osgood G, and White E  



#### Introduction  

Understanding the impacts of wildlife export trade on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is critical for effective regulation of animal trade. Recently, studies have identified IUCN hotspots subject to high levels of export (Moran & Kanemoto, 2017, Nature), and identified variation in  governance effectiveness across countries (Dee et al. 2014, Biol. Cons.; Cardador et al. 2017, Cons. Lett.). In coral reefs, aquarium trade of fish species can add exploitation pressure to lower trophic levels and remove highly-threatened species, but traded species are often unregulated and export data is unavailable (Rhyne et al. 2012 PLoS ONE; Deet et al. 2014). Consequently, our understanding of regional variation in aquarium pressure and target species is limited.

We propose to analyse regional variation in reef fish species exported to the US, particularly considering impacts on IUCN and CITES listed species in the context of country-level fisheries sustainability.

## Research questions  

#### Question 1
How effective are trade regulations in controlling aquarium export? Compare aquarium exports from countries with strong vs weak regulations/governance, based on CITES membership, n. years since joining CITES, and GDP (CITES information: https://www.cites.org/eng/disc/parties/chronolo.php).

**Data**: CITES - how effective are countries governance, protection measures etc.? Lit search for metrics - JMI has UN human dev. indicators; EW has World Bank governance indicators

**Expectation**: countries with poor governance have higher trade export volume + diversity (standardised to reef area/coastline/regional richness). 

Consider temporal aspect here as well - does good/bad governance in year 1 reduce/increase fish trade in year 2?

#### Question 2

Are certain trophic levels or functional groups disproportionately targeted by aquarium trade, and does this pattern vary regionally? Examine size, diet, and functional group structure of exported species by country. 

**Data**: Requires functional group data. James has this for Indo-Pacific fishes.

**Expectation**: planktivores are primarily targeted. Are there 1) countries that export more herbs/piscs than expected? 2) Which non-planktivore species are exported in high volumes? 

**Caveats**: 1) Standardise countries by estimating proportional volume of functional groups for each country; 2) determining the baseline community structure is very difficult, probably impossible.

#### Question 3

Geographic analysis of range distributions - where are species exported from? Are small or large range size fishes exported more or less? small range - which species? large range - lots of export countries?

**Data**: JR emailed Rhyne AGAIN (22nd May) to check on this.

**Expectation**: linear relationship between export volume ~ range size. But any species that falls off the line is of interest: 1) smaller range size for volume = high risk; 2) larger range size than volume = low risk?

**Caveat:** This question is country-independent - ranges cross borders, data point = fish species.
