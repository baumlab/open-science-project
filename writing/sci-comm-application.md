My research takes me to remote tropical coral reefs where I try and understand how subsistence fishing impacts these vulnerable ecosystems. In 2013, I visited Kiritimati (pronounced 'Christmas') Atoll as a member of a research team completing routine monitoring of the fish and coral, and documenting the socio-economic status of 'i-Kiribati' islanders. One of my responsibilities was to conduct interviews with local families and fishers - we wanted to identify the best fishing grounds and quantify Kiritimati's seafood consumption in terms of species, volume, and dollar value.

Among routine questions - 'How many times a week do you eat fish? How many family members are employed in the fishery? What fishing gear do you use?' - our survey also asked interviewees how rising sea levels might impact their homes and families in the next few decades. For the i-Kiribati, putting food on the table tomorrow was a more urgent concern than sea level change in 2030, while others were unaware that their climate was changing. Faced with apathy or ignorance, I struggled to convey the importance of climate change in these interviews, aware that I was unfamiliar with the demands of subsistence livelihoods in a remote tropical community. 

My teaching and communication tools help me to simplify complex scientific topics for academic audiences. On Kiritimati Atoll, I found myself needing new skills that would allow me to bridge cultural differences to communicate meaningfully with the people whose lives depend the health of the reef.

In 2012 I flew from Scotland to BC, Canada to start a marine ecology PhD, learning the scientific trade from Canadian ecologists while travelling to Pacific atolls to think about subsistence fishing on coral reefs. My undergraduate degree left me with skills in seabird ecology, and several research trips to Filipino, Caribbean, and north African coral reefs provided me with tropical research experience. However, at 24 years old, I didn't fully appreciate the significance of emigrating to a country 8 time zones from home, with distinct ecosystems and different cultural values.

After several years spent figuring out the GPA system, incorrectly identifying iconic trees to undergraduate classes, and developing an unpleasant Canadian-Scottish accent, I had found a new home. Looking back, moving abroad was a hugely significant decision, which tested me personally but trained me to Canadian ecological principles.

Canada has a long record of producing influential ecologists, such as Bill Ricker, one of the fathers of fisheries science. In the public, respect and appreciation of natural resources contrast sharply with the government's environmental policies - pristine and logged forests, productive but overexploited fisheries, and unsustainable fossil fuel extraction. Living and learning in a society where ecology is at the forefront of conversation gave me a unique perspective on the importance of ecological research, particularly in thinking about scientific communication between stakeholders and shareholders. As I return to the UK to start a professional research position, my work will forever be informed by Canada's relationship with its environment.
