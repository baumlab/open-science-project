#### Data required from Aquariumtradedata.org

1. Number of individuals, by species, exported by each country to the US in 2008, 2009, 2011

2. CITES membership for each country, and list of CITES protected species

- databases for CITES information (https://www.speciesplus.net/ and http://checklist.cites.org/#/en)

3. List of species with IUCN Red List status  

You also mentioned longer term invertebrate data. We would like to focus on the fish for now, just to get ourselves familiar with the dataset and because our backgrounds are all in reef fish. Going forward, if we find interesting results with the fish trade, we would certainly be interested in extending our approach to think about other species.


Very few IUCN listed fish sp.
CITES = seahorses, corals, clams

Geographic analysis of range distributions - where are species exported from? small range - which species? large range - lots of export countries?

Distribution data - Global Biodiversity Index

Some of the distributions are errors.


Big changes over time with fish trade - carnivores fall off, smaller fish go up.

#### Unanswerable research questions

1. Are certain regions or countries experiencing stronger impacts from aquarium trade? Use IUCN data to identify aquarium trade "threat hotspots", defined as A) the number of Red List species exported by a country and B) the number of species that are also threatened by fishing

*Low number of IUCN species. Probably not fished species.*

2. Are threat hotspots in systems that are already considered highly threatened? Examine relationship between coral reef fishery condition at threat hotspots, using published fishery sustainability estimates (e.g. Newton et al. 2007, Current Biology).

*No - fishery condition? No idea*
