#### Question 1
How effective are trade regulations in controlling aquarium export? Compare aquarium exports from countries with strong vs weak regulations/governance, based on CITES membership, n. years since joining CITES, and GDP (CITES information: https://www.cites.org/eng/disc/parties/chronolo.php).

**Data**: CITES, UN human development indicators, World Bank Governance Indicators

**Expectation**: countries with poor governance have higher trade export volume + diversity (standardised to reef area/coastline/regional richness). 

Consider temporal aspect here as well - does good/bad governance in year 1 reduce/increase fish trade in year 2?

**Caveats** How to use the governance indicators when they are yearly and the data is from multiple years and months within certain years?

#### Question 2

Are certain trophic levels or functional groups disproportionately targeted by aquarium trade, and does this pattern vary regionally? Examine size, diet, and functional group structure of exported species by country. 

**Data**: CREP trophic groups (lots of data missing for our species), FishBase (only two of our species matched), JPWR looking for another dataset  

**Expectation**: planktivores are primarily targeted. Are there 1) countries that export more herbs/piscs than expected? 2) Which non-planktivore species are exported in high volumes? 

**Caveats**: 1) Standardise countries by estimating proportional volume of functional groups for each country; 2) determining the baseline community structure is very difficult, probably impossible.

#### Question 3

Geographic analysis of range distributions - where are species exported from? Are small or large range size fishes exported more or less? small range - which species? large range - lots of export countries?

**Data**: OBIS range sizes (how to calculate range size from lat/long presence data?), Luis et al. 2013 range size data 

**Expectation**: linear relationship between export volume ~ range size. But any species that falls off the line is of interest: 1) smaller range size for volume = high risk; 2) larger range size than volume = low risk?

**Caveat:** This question is country-independent - ranges cross borders, data point = fish species.
