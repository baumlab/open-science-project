#### Overarching goals

1) Are aquarium fish export countries characterised by specific habitat (reef area, biogeography) and governance (CITES, development) traits?

(is there an analogue to this in the conservation literature? for trade of another taxa)

2) Are traded reef fish characterised by specific ecological traits? 

(similar idea to Graham et al. 2011 Extinction vulnerability of coral reef reef fishes. Ecology Letters.)

Make predictions about aquarium trade based on 1) exporting country information, such as governance factors (CITES, development), and 2) species information, such as trophic group, range size. Trade volume is a big problem just now, because it is very skewed towards a couple of major exporters (PNG and Philippines). There may also be discrepancies in volume estimates due to incorrect labelling of fish + exported boxes (Rhyne et al. 2012), but this seems less of an issue if we just analyse occurence of species being exported.

Response variable: If a species was exported or not (0,1) (binomial) (Also look at how many countries export that fish species?)

We probably need to control for reef area and biogeography here as well (Parravicini et al. 2013). Caribbean species can be exported by X countries, whereas Indo-Pacific species can be exported by Y countries - we want to measure effect of predictors *given* that there is a geographical constraint on how many countries can export each species. Kulbicki et al. (2013, PLoS ONE) has a dataset of biogeographical zones we could use for country level groupings - does anyone know of a species level equivalent?

#### Question 1
*How effective are trade regulations in controlling aquarium export?*  

**Hypotheses**: Countries with poor governance will trade more species (standardised to reef area/coastline/regional richness). 

**Data**: CITES, UN human development indicators, World Bank Governance Indicators

Consider temporal aspect here as well - does good/bad governance in year 1 reduce/increase fish trade in year 2?

Standardizing issue seems key here. We really need to understand why some countries have huge trade exports - Philippines has big coastline, reef area and regional diversity, but export demand is also driven by market factors (e.g. Philippines probably has quite strong trade links with the US). Or consider Christmas island - small reef area + coastline, but high demand for one species (flame angel).

*Caveats* 

* How to use the governance indicators when they are yearly and the data is from multiple years and months within certain years? 
* Do we expect governance changes to take immediate effect on fish trade? Perhaps, if trade laws specifically change, but this seems unlikely to occur in a lot of countries, and it would be difficult to find comparable predictors among countries.

#### Question 2

*Are certain trophic levels or functional groups disproportionately targeted by aquarium trade, and does this pattern vary regionally? * 

**Hypotheses**: The planktivores are primarily targeted because of their size (small, easy to collect many and popular for small aquariums). 

**Data**: FishBase (89 of our 100 species matched). Provides FoodTL estimates = 

*Caveats*: 1) Standardise countries by estimating proportional volume of functional groups for each country; 2) determining the baseline community structure is very difficult, probably impossible.  

JR: I think these figures are a little wonky - watch out for horizontal lines within ggplot bars - suggests that multiple numbers are being used to build one bar, and it doesn't know how to combine the data. Have remade for single data points per bar.

#### Question 3

*Geographic analysis of range distributions - where are species exported from? Are small or large range size fishes exported more or less?*

**Hypotheses**: There will be a positive linear relationship of export occurences and range size, as species with a larger range size will exported by more countries. However if any species fall of this line they are of interest: 1) smaller range size for volume = high risk; 2) larger range size than volume = low risk?

**Data**: OBIS range sizes (from this calculated EOO: extent of occurence and AOO: area of occurence), Luis et al. 2013 range size data. The figures below are for EOO

*Caveat:* This question is country-independent - ranges cross borders, data point = fish species.  

*Problem 1)* Each point is one species volume and range size (i.e. averaged by  years and summed by country), however when doing this I noticed that there aren't any fish taax that have exports in one country for multiple years? This seems odd.  

JR: This is super weird. I have emailed Andrew Rhyne to query.

*Problem 2)* There are lots of fish species that have 0 calculated as the range size, not NA (those were already filtered out). Should we get rid of these species because maybe they have only been picked up by OBIS in one area so thats why they have an EOO of zero?   

Update: for the top 100 subsetted there is only this problem for *Gobiodon atrangulatus*. It only has two occurences in the OBIS dataset, thus making its EOO zero.  

JR: Probably yes.

#### Data Decisions  

* using all years of data since we are not using volume as the response variable  
* subset to the top 100 species exported (by volume)  
* only look species occurence not volume because of large outliers driven by a couple of countries  
* we need to check each species in the top 100 - are they reef-associated? Are they traded for aquaria? I have opened issue on this.

#### Modeling Ideas  

Statistical models must make predictions on our fixed covariates of interest (range size, governance, species traits) while accounting for our random covariates of confounding information (biogeographic region, country, family). Random levels could be used to make family- or region-level predictions of the fixed covariate relationships.
```
glmer(occurence ~ range size + (1 + range size | year / country), data=trade, family = Gamma(link=log))  
```
* random slope for country OR biogeographic region, random intercept for year  
* Poisson distribution
* or could try gls() variance structures? (varfixed, varpower) instead of transforming  

```
glmer(occurence ~ range size + (1| year / country), data=trade, family = Gamma(link=log))  
``` 
* random intercept for year  

So then the full model would be (depending on which random structure is best):  

Incidence models:
```
glmer(occurence ~ range size + CITES + gov.indicator + trophic + (1 + range size | year / region), data=trade, family = Gamma(link=log))  
```
