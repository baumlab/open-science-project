Human threats to biodiversity, conservation and trade

Previous work on the coral reef aquarium trade

Gap: statistical analysis of aquarium trade data, identifying threatened species and regions 

Our Study: goals, questions, hypotheses

Our goal here is to understand what is driving coral reef aquarium trade based on exporting country information (e.g. goverance indicators) and species information (e.g. trophic group and range size). We ask the questions 1) how effective are trade regulations in controlling aquarium export? 2) Are certain functional groups disproportionately targeted by aquarium trade, and does this pattern vary regionally? and 3) Are fish species with different range sizes disproportionately targeted by aquarium trade? 


# Methods {-}

Any data subsetting, decisions, transformations. 
- modeled and not-modeled  
- only use presence/absence data 

Datasets used: Rhyne aquarium trade, fishbase, OBIS, UN governance indicators  

Statistical analyses: GLM with binary response of trade  
-variance structure  
-fixed effects selection
