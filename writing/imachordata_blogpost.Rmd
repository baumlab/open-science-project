#### Introducing the Open Derby

Ensuring openness and reproducibility in ecology is an ongoing challenge, although open tools ([R Studio](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [Github](https://github.com/)) are free to use and user support is everywhere. To help ecology labs switch to their collaborations into an open science framework, we had the idea of running an 'Open Derby'. Similar to a [research derby](http://www.researchderby.org/what-is-a-research-derby.html), where grad students and post-docs collaborate together to solve a conservation problem, our idea extends the derby concept to working fully openly: learning version control in GitHub, writing and analysing data in RMarkdown, and publishing all project development in an open notebook. Our end goal was to examine a conservation issue using open access (OA) data, and publish our findings and code in an OA journal. Ultimately, we hope to share Open Derby with other graduate students and academics across the life sciences, with the hope that we can provide a model for switching entire lab groups into open and reproducible research machines. 

If you aren't familiar with open science tools, RMarkdown is a wonderful method of writing code into a manuscript that can be formatted into manuscripts, reports, and presentations, which we use in tandem with GitHub, a service that allows version control of your data, analyses and manuscripts, and is incredibly useful for managing input between collaborators. We are six PhD students from 4 institutions based in 3 countries, who are present or past members of Dr. Julia Baum's marine ecology lab at the University of Victoria and have come together to demo the Open Derby concept:

In January 2017, we met to decide on a research question for Open Derby and **SPOILER**, we failed in our first attempt. In the interests of openness, and [publishing null results](http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2015/02/25/positively-negative-new-plos-one-collection-focusing-negative-null-inconclusive-results/), here is what we did:

#### Our conservation question - quantifying oil spill impacts across regions

In light of [recent political moves towards greater oil extraction in N America](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/business/energy-environment/keystone-oil-pipeline.html?_r=0), we decided to examine oil spill impacts across the west coast of North America. We focused on shellfish fisheres, reasoning that sessile organisms would experience high mortality soon after an oil spill (e.g. [shellfish](http://eg.geoscienceworld.org/content/6/2/90), often [mussels](http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/science/article/pii/S0269749107004952) and more [mussels](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141113600001033)), and that subsequent fisheries closures (e.g. [English Bay, BC, Canada](http://www.vch.ca/about-us/news/archive/2015-news/fishing-closure-in-response-to-the-english-bay-oil-spill), [Gulf of Mexico, USA](http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/deepwater_horizon/closure_info/), [Santa Barbara, CA, USA](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/OSPR/Science/Laboratories/Chemistry/Special-Projects/Fishery-Closure)) would instantly impact catch. 

#### Open datasets - oil spills and fisheries catch

We extracted oil spill data from the Emergency Response Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA; [https://incidentnews.noaa.gov/raw/index](https://incidentnews.noaa.gov/raw/index)) which recorded all major spills that occurred between 1967-2016 in marine environments on the west coasts of U.S.A. and Canada (Figure 1). However, we were unale to find oil spill data from British Columbia. After extensive web searches, emails and even a [freedom of information request](https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-make-freedom-information-request), we were told there is no existing electronic database that categorizes all of the oil spills occurring off the coast of British Columbia.

**Figure 1** Oil spill location and size across west coast of North America from 1967-2016 included in NOAA's incident news dataset.

We extracted fisheries catch data from the [Sea Around Us Project](http://www.seaaroundus.org/) (SaU), which collates global, spatially-explicit estimates of annual fisheries catch at the national level ([Pauly & Zeller 2015](http://www.seaaroundus.org/doc/Researcher+Publications/dzeller/PDF/Papers/2016/Pauly%26Zeller-Global-Catch-Nature-Communications-2016.pdf); [Zeller et al. 2016](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X16302421)). The SaU dataset uses international and national catch statistics to generate taxon-level catch estimates at a 0.5 degree resolution, spanning 1950-2013, and provided us with California, Oregon, Washington, BC, and Alaska fisheries catch. Yet, as promising as this data appeared at first, we were advised not use this data at spatial scales below the EEZ level. We also contacted Canadian and US fisheries departments to request port-level catch data. 

Sadly, data resolution issues sunk our project. With fishing catch data, smaller spatial aggregations of the SaU dataset were simply EEZ level trends with catch estimates scaled downwards (Figure 2), and we did not reasonably expect to detect oil spill impacts at the EEZ level. We were also unable to locate consistent port-level data that spanned either BC, California, or Alaska. Similarly, the oil spill incidents were not consistently reported, and it was unclear how spill estimates were generated - a contact from NOAA warned us that there was no established methodology for estimating the size of oil spill, and many incident amounts might amount to guesswork.

Beyond our data issues, the ecological impact of an oil spill is highly context-dependent, and will be affected by the environmental conditions, clean-up response, and type of oil contaminant. As a result, our understanding of oil spill impacts on marine ecosystems is, sadly, limited to large, catastrophic events. We urge more openness and data collection of spill characteristics, so that researchers may begin to quantify the cumulative impacts of smaller, more frequent spills on marine ecosystems.

#### Future Work

You can find our ideas, data, and progress in our [public Github repository](https://github.com/baumlab/open-science-project). We welcome any suggestions that might help us to resurrect this project, and hope to inspire others to write up their failed projects so that others might benefit from our ideas. Our project lead - James Robinson - is currently developing Open Derby for general consumption as a member of [Mozilla's Open Science Leadership training programme](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/projects/). 

But, we are now brainstorming conservation questions for our next attempt. Ecologists, please, send us your unanswered conservation problems, unanalyzed datasets, and suggestions for advancing open ecology!
