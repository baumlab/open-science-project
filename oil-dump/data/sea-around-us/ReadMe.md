### Sea Around US Catch Data 
Sea Around Us Data: landings + discards are not separate

At SAU, we define commercial catch as any catch in the Industrial and Artisanal sectors.

Caveats:
"We can give that data, however, you need to be fully aware of the caveats and limitations of our spatial allocation at scales that are below the scale of EEZs. 

Our data and allocation were designed for a global large-scale use, not a sub-EEZ spatial use. 

Furthermore, local factors such as oil spills or anything as such are never considered in our data. 

Finally, spatial allocation to 1/2 degree cells that are coastal, are most problematic, given the global scale of all our work. 

We generally recommend that researchers use other, local and regional research data for spatial work at sub-EEZ levels."


### Fishing Cost Data
"For the fishing cost database, we are still in the process of updating it now. We do not have time series data for the previous version. All the fishing cost data is standardized to 2005 real dollar in this version. Also, the fishing cost data is by country and fishing gear type.
 
For the objective of your study, I assumed that you may only need the fishing cost data of the USA and Canada. Attached please find the data of these two countries by gear types. I?m attaching the paper about the fishing cost data for your reference."

-Travis will send us the price data soon :)
