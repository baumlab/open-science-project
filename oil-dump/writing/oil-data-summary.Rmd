#### Summarising oil data

We used oil spill data collected by NOAAâ€™s Office of Response and Restoration. They recorded incident data whenever they provided support in response to a spill ([NOAA's Raw Incident Data](https://incidentnews.noaa.gov/raw/index)). The dataset includes information on spill location, an estimate of spill size (e.g. gallons), spill substance, and what measures may have been taken in response to the spill (e.g. dispersants). 

*"This may be a known quantity or the upper bound of a minimum-maximum estimate. Note that different commodities have different toxicities and reaction characteristics, so 10,000 gallons of one material may be more significant than 10,000 gallons of another."*

Spill incidents occurred all over the world and included spills between 19XX and 20XX. We filtered this data set through several criteria. We excluded Chemical and Other spill types, leaving `r length(unique(oil.west$id))` oil spills from `r min(oil.west$Date)` to `r max(oil.west$Date)`. Spill region covers West coast of USA and Canada (latitude: `r round(min(oil.west$lat), digits=2)`, `r round(max(oil.west$lat), digits=2)`; longitude: `r round(min(oil.west$lon), digits=2)`, `r round(max(oil.west$lon), digits=2)`) (Figure 1,2).

Spill size reported for `r length(unique(oil.west$id)[oil.west$max_ptl_release_gallons>0])/length(unique(oil.west$id))*100` of spills, with majority of spills < 1000 gallons (`r length(oil.west$max_ptl_release_gallons<1000)`) (Figure 3).

*How is 'max_ptl_release_gallons' variable measured?*

*(Note that different commodities have different toxicities and reaction characteristics, so 10,000 gallons of one material may be more significant than 10,000 gallons of another.)*
